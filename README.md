# globalwarmingprediction
The project aim is to implement a solution for the analyse the data from the dataset and visualize the prediction of the temperature or humidity. When performing the data analysis i came across many scenarios that restrict me to analyse the specific data as user wants. The factors that make restricts such as missing data, enormous number of data of many cities from 16 countries which contain each and every temperature data and humidity data from 1840 - 2013 almost 40 million data. In order to get rid of that issue, Data analyse technique has been used. But in the data prediction part the solution cannon be able to visualize the 100% accurate solution.
